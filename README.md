## Building from sources

**It seems that latest Ubuntu Desktop versions are not supported by Cordova-cli and so original 16.04 Ubuntu is required to build seabass (at least 16.04.2 is not supported due to problems with schroot)**

Automatic build script is available since v0.2.9, see [seabass-build](https://github.com/milikhin/seabass-build) project.
Manual [build instructions](building.md) are also available.
